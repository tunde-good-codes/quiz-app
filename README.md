📚 Why I Built It

To provide high school students with a hands-on tool to practice coding concepts.

To reinforce learning in a fun, interactive way, without needing any backend infrastructure.

To demonstrate building a static web app using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — proving that powerful learning tools don’t require complex setups.
